      "Hey there, fellow students! Are you tired of juggling your assignments, deadlines, and class schedules like a circus performer? Meet TimetableX (timetablex.com)! Co-founded by yours truly, this nifty platform has already attracted 200 users and boasts about 50 daily active users‚Äîall enjoying a smoother, more organized academic life!",

      "What‚Äôs the magic behind TimetableX? Well, for starters, we‚Äôve crafted a feature that lets you share assessment details within your modules. No more missed deadlines or hidden assignments‚Äîeveryone in your class can stay in the loop! Plus, our internal notification system sends you automated reminders, so you never forget that important coursework again. üåü",

      "But that‚Äôs not all! With a persistent to-do list and a customizable UI featuring over 30 themes, you can tailor your study experience to fit your style, whether you‚Äôre on your desktop or your phone. I coded this beauty using TypeScript and React on the front end, with a sprinkle of Python on the back end for good measure.",

      "Oh, and did I mention our web scraper? It maps room locations from iCal data and caches events for 24 hours, making sure you‚Äôre always in the right place at the right time. With a robust MongoDB model featuring 11 collections and integrated with Prisma ORM, we ensure everything runs smoothly, even adapting to your timezone! üïí",

      "We‚Äôre in talks with the University of Leeds to enhance their timetabling system, and TimetableX is here to support students at both Leeds and York universities.

My aim? To make coding smoother and faster for developers everywhere!",

      "One of my proudest achievements was optimizing the fine-tuning speed by a whopping 50% using LoRa on NVIDIA P100 GPUs! Talk about turbocharging my models! ‚ö° I also designed a reusable pipeline for fine-tuning on new data, ensuring that anyone can leverage these powerful tools with ease.",

      "Throughout my research, I made some intriguing discoveries: I found that accuracy tends to decrease after 100 tokens in docstrings, with an exponential increase in generation time for longer sequences‚Äîexcept when using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) models. It turns out that code-comment models shine when predicting multiple tokens consecutively, achieving an impressive 81% accuracy on CodeSearchNet and 70% on CodeNN (with C++ excluded from training).",

      "But that's not all! I also crafted a general fine-tuning algorithm that can work across multiple Transformer-based models, making it a versatile tool for future projects. And the cherry on top? I received a First-Class mark for this work! üéâ",

Next, the parser takes those tokens and constructs a parse tree while ensuring your code adheres to JACK's syntax rules. It even checks for semantic errors, like variable redeclarations!",

We achieved a reliable communication range of 100 meters, making our projects truly mobile!",

I refactored the code to allow students to customize their RC cars' behaviors based on button presses, and we even programmed animations for a monochrome display using u8g2.
