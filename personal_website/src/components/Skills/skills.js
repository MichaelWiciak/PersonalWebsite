      <span className="skillDesc">
        I’m someone who loves diving into complex problems, whether it’s coding
        up a solution, tuning a machine learning model, or hacking together
        something cool for a group project.
        <br />
        <br />
        Right now, my playground is software engineering.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’ve gotten hands-on with everything from developing an app to automate
        badminton court bookings (because why not?) to creating a scheduler to
        help students stay on top of deadlines.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m always chasing something new, whether it’s a coding challenge, a
        cool project idea, or simply learning how to work smarter.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you’re looking for someone who’s not afraid to roll up their sleeves
        and get into the nitty-gritty of tech, I’m your person.
